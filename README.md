# The bones library suite of Palisand

This library suite contains libraries for common tasks in applications. I know they are equivalents of well known libraries that many use. But this project gives me the opportunity to create alternatives that I think is better even though you may think otherwise. The libraries do not rely on many dependencies, so the resulting jars are tiny and can be used in any contexts.

## bones-core: Dependency injection framework

[bones-core](https://github.com/tptg/bones/bones-core) is an alternative to Spring context or Google Juice. It is extreme simple and powerful. It consists of just one class and one interface. It does not rely on Annotations and classpath scanning. As added bonus, it will not be bothered by cycles in dependencies. It will handle it without any problems.

## bones-log: Logging framework

[bones-log](bones-log)
